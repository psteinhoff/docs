Introduction

OpenPTV is the open source particle tracking velocimetry software consortium. The software
is based on the core algorithms of the previous 3D-PTV software from ETH Zurich. We modified
the core algorithms to become a stand-alone library with simple and clear API. We also
develop the new user interface in Python. 

In the future we would like to allow everyone to add their algorithms to the OpenPTV 
library, named `liboptv` and develop several interfaces, combining it with the pre- 
and post-processing routines using Python/NumPy/SciPy/PIL/Matplotlib/Mayavi/etc.
